    <p>
      Writing clean valid code and designing web applications is my passion.
      It's part of my everyday life, and I'm really enjoying it. I started
      programming in school and since then fall in love with software
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduation, I decided to try myself in design and spent a few years
      working in printing and advertising agencies. At some point, I finally get
      to what I'm doing now - combining design and programming skills to build
      user interfaces for the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love trying new technologies, finding new ways of doing things better,
      and learning new stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides that, I also love playing & writing music, shooting photos, and
      traveling.
